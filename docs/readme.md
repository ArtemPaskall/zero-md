> Ridiculously simple zero-config markdown displayer

A native markdown-to-html web component based on [Custom Elements V1 specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/)
to load and display an external MD file. Under the hood, it uses [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) for
super-fast markdown transformation, and [Prism](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for feature-packed syntax
highlighting - automagically rendering into its own self-contained shadow DOM container, while encapsulating
implementation details into one embarassingly easy-to-use package.

**NOTE: This is documentation for V2. If you're looking for the older version, see the [V1 docs](https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/v1/).**

**NOTE: V2 is in pre-release and documentation is in progress. Stay tuned!**
